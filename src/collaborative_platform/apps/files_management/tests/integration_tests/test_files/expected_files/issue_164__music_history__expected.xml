                Wow, this sub just never ceases to amaze me. This just might be the worst post yet. Is this supposed to
                be funny? Because it just isn't. How can you honestly sit there and tell me music hasn't been going
                downhill since <name xml:id="name-9" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#band-0">Queen</name> (RIP
                <name xml:id="name-10" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-9">Freddy Mercury</name>). Do you even know what
                real music is? All this shit about
                mom's lasagna and ladybugs is just complete and utter garbage. You hear songs from the
                <date xml:id="date-0" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#date-0" when="1960-01-01">60s</date>
                and <date xml:id="date-1" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#date-1" when="1970-01-01">70s</date> that
                are still so iconic they are featured all the time. Today's music just doesn't have that staying power.
                It is just formulaic filth that panders to whatever today's youth is into. You think you can honestly
                sit there and tell me people will still be listening to
                <name xml:id="name-11" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-7">Katy Perry</name> and
                <name xml:id="name-12" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-8">Nicki Minaj</name>
                <date xml:id="date-2" ref="date-3" resp="#annotator-0" when="2044-01-01">30 years from now</date>?
                Yeah fucking right. You still hear
                <name xml:id="name-13" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#song-0">we are the champions</name>
                by <name xml:id="name-14" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#band-0">queen</name> at every single sporting
                even in the
                world. No song made today will last anywhere close to that long. And where's the emotion? Where's the
                feeling? Back in my day artists actually put thought into what they wrote. And that's just it. Today's
                artists don't even write their own songs anymore. They get some guy with a degree in bullshit who makes
                money engineering these meaningless but catchy songs that rake in millions only because the record
                companies are forcing radio stations to play them every ten seconds to get them stuck in people's heads
                so that is all they can think of. This simply didn't happen in the
                <date xml:id="date-3" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#date-1">70s</date>.
                People made songs based on how
                they were feeling. And guess what, their music also had impacts on what was going on in the world. You
                guys have probably never heard of him, but there was this indie guy named
                <name xml:id="name-15" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-6">John Lennon</name> who wrote a song
                about imagining the world without any violence. Now that's the type of stuff we need in today's music.
                Something to inspire the youth to do something good. That's why kids are always getting in so much
                trouble now. The music is telling them to fuck everything that moves and beat the shit out of each
                other. So they do it. No questions asked. And don't even get me started on today's celebrity worship. Do
                we really need to know every time
                <name xml:id="name-16" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-4">Kim Kardashian</name> is taking a shit?
                Seriously, who gives a fuck what
                those idiots are doing. Why are they even famous in the first place? And all this obsession with
                technology is driving us into idiots. You see with the most recent
                <name xml:id="name-17" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#org-1">facebook</name> scandal how easy it is for
                them to manipulate you. Do you guys even realize that
                <name xml:id="name-18" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#org-1">facebook</name> was designed for
                college students? Anyone
                under the age of 18 should not be allowed on it. Simple as that. I think you should be required to
                register with a .edu email when creating an account. That also keeps out the idiots that can't get into
                college and the poor people that can't afford it. And back in my day we didn't even need
                <name xml:id="name-0" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#org-1">facebook</name>, if
                you wanted to contact someone, you had to call their house. And guess what, if they weren't home, you
                didn't talk to them. We also had to memorize each others phone numbers by heart. Kids these days have it
                too easy putting everyone's numbers in their phones. And
                <name xml:id="name-1" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#org-2">twitter</name> is even worse. #what is the point
                of these things? Seriously, I don't get it. They are just made up catchphrases that make you sound stupid.
                And what is with advertisers trying to get me to use them? Like when a couple guys are going hiking and
                spot some wildlife and you see #ladybugs. Stop popping those things up in the middle of my show. I don't
                fucking care! Now I know you guys all agree with everything I just said but are going to down vote me
                anyway to try and fit in with the group. And that's fine. But listen to this first. Today's music is
                ruining this planet. Pretty soon there will be riots in the streets that will make
                <name xml:id="name-2" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-5">Rodney king</name> Dwarf in
                comparison. <name xml:id="name-3" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-9">Freddy Mercury</name> will rise
                from the dead and lead the charge in murdering
                <name xml:id="name-4" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-0">Mark Zuckerberg</name>,
                <name xml:id="name-5" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#org-0">the Kardashians</name>,
                <name xml:id="name-6" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-1">Justin Bieber</name>, and
                every other trendy celebrity that is ruining the youths. It will be
                called "the modern cleansing where a new renaissance will emerge. We will see
                <name xml:id="name-7" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-2">Davinci</name> and
                <name xml:id="name-8" resp="#annotator-0" ref="#person-3">Michelangelo</name>
                rise again and bring new artistic beauty in this world. And you will all see just how bad it really was.

                    100 iconic moments from music history
                    Think back to the first concert you ever attended. You can probably remember the energy of the crowd
                    yearning for the band to finally take the stage, the reverberation of the first strum of the guitar,
                    the
                    beats of the drum that seemed to thump inside your body. The lights, the charisma of the performers,
                    finally hearing your favorite songs live—as they were meant to be listened to—the experience remains
                    vivid for the rest of your life. You might still have the overpriced T-shirt you bought as a
                    souvenir of
                    the show buried in your closet.

                    There’s something about music that embeds itself deeply inside memories. But this phenomenon doesn’t
                    just happen at the individual level—music can form a collective cultural memory, as well. If you
                    think
                    back over the past few generations, certain moments in music stand out as markers of time and
                    reflections of a generation. Anyone alive in 1980 can tell you where they were when

                    There are also those hopeful, unforgettable shows—like

                    No
                    matter how you feel about these artists, there’s no doubt that they made an impact on culture and
                    changed music for future generations.

                    To compile a list of the most iconic moments in music history, Stacker looked at an assortment of
                    sources, including music publications such as Billboard and Rolling Stone, general news outlets like
                    the
                    Guardian and NPR, and Norman Abjorensen’s “Historical Dictionary of Popular Music.” While there were
                    no
                    strict criteria for what was included, a wide range of memorable moments, like record-breaking
                    albums,
                    major music festivals, and headline-making stunts by musicians from a variety of decades and genres
                    are
                    showcased.

                    While there had been other devices
                    that could record and play audio, the phonograph was far more reliable, making music accessible to
                    the
                    masses. “It forever transformed the face of music,” wrote

                    Swing Low, Sweet Chariot establishes the black spiritual in music history
                    African American a cappella group The Fisk Jubilee recorded “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” in 1909. The
                    song
                    would be instrumental in preserving African American spiritual folksongs in American history,

                    Jazz and blues singer Bessie Smith saw immediate success after her first recorded song, “Down
                    Hearted
                    Blues,” was released in 1923. She is now considered one of the greatest vocalists of her time and an
                    influence on future generations of blues and jazz singers.

                    Frank Sinatra performs to crazed teen fans in Times Square
                    America got its first glimpse of teen music fandom when Frank Sinatra performed at New York City’s
                    Paramount Theater on Dec. 30, 1942. Frenzied “bobby soxers” flooded Times Square for the occasion
                    and a
                    riot broke out. The event would drive the music industry to shift its marketing efforts to
                    adolescent
                    fans, rather than 30-to-50-year-olds, according to Samantha Sokol of Untapped New York.

                    The first-ever rock ’n’ roll song, “Rocket 88,” was recorded by Ike Turner in 1951 in Memphis,
                    Tennessee. Saxophone player Jackie Brenston sang lead vocals on the track, which was released under
                    his
                    name, according to Christopher John Farley of Time magazine.

                    Coronation Ball in 1952. Widely considered the first notable rock ’n’ roll concert, the event was

                    1954.
                    The guitar revolutionized the sound of rock, according to Norman Abjorensen, author of “Historical
                    Dictionary of Popular Music.” It would be the instrument of choice for a number of famous musicians,
                    including Beck, Ritchie Blackmore, Eric Clapton, and Buddy Holly.

                    Milton Berle Show” in June 1956. Fans loved it, but critics blasted the pelvis-shaking dance moves
                    as
                    vulgar, according to PBS.

                    Phil Spector formulates the Wall of Sound
                    Record producer Phil Spector invented the Wall of Sound music production formula in 1962. The
                    radical
                    recording technique, which created a soundscape with many layers and more reverb, would add immense
                    dynamism to rock and pop music.

                    Bob Dylan’s stream-of-consciousness song “Like a Rolling Stone” was released in 1965. The 6-minute
                    song
                    was a change from formulaic pop songs that typically clocked in at under three minutes, and is
                    credited
                    as giving birth to the modern rock song, according to Sean O’Hagan of The Guardian.

                    The event may have ended the Folk Revival movement that he helped lead, and would go on to influence

                    Ronald Reagan references Bruce Springsteen in 1984 campaign
                    After Bruce Springsteen turned down a request to use “Born in the U.S.A” in former President Ronald
                    Reagan’s 1984 reelection campaign, the conservative politician mentioned the musician in a speech,
                    saying helping men like him make dreams come true is the purpose of the president’s job, according
                    to
                    Steven Inskeep of NPR Music. The Boss began criticizing Reagan for not really listening to his music
                    shortly after, and he would soon become known as an outspoken liberal.

                    Prince, in 1985, she created the Parents Music Resource Center to lobby for censorship in the record
                    industry. The PMRC developed its “Filthy 15” list of what it deemed were the most offensive songs of

                    In the music video for her “…Baby One More Time” debut single, 16-year-old pop artist Britney Spears
                    wore a midriff-revealing Catholic schoolgirl uniform, complete with a miniskirt. The ensemble proved
                    controversial among parents, but made pigtails and pom-pom hair ties trendy among teens.

                    Woodstock ’99 fails miserably
                    Meant to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original music festival, Woodstock ’99 turned out to
                    be a
                    massive failure. The notorious multi-day event had exorbitant ticket prices, $4 bottles of water,
                    overcrowding, poor performances, multiple sexual assaults, and a number of other serious problems
                    that
                    left the crowds enraged, according to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone.

                    Metallica sues Napster for copyright infringement
                    The metal band took peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster to court in April 2000 over copyright
                    violations. Napster lost and would go bankrupt soon after. The internet’s disruption of music
                    distribution and record label profits would continue for decades, though.
